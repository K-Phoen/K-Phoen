### Hi there 👋

I'm an experienced Backend Engineer, currently working for [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) in Stockholm, Sweden.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Grabana](https://github.com/K-Phoen/grabana) & [DARK](https://github.com/K-Phoen/dark), embedding monitoring & alerting right into the development cycle
- 💫 I poke around [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) and maintain a few OSS plugins: [backstage-plugin-announcements](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-announcements/), [backstage-plugin-confluence](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-confluence/), [backstage-plugin-grafana](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-grafana/), [backstage-plugin-opsgenie](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-opsgenie)
- ✍️ Sometimes I write stuff on [my blog](https://blog.kevingomez.fr/)
- 💬 Ask me about Developer Experience, engineering practices, observability, automation, software design, … or anything you are passionate about!
- 📫 Reach me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KPhoen)
